# Conceptual components extraction

Here you can find:

- ``project_root``: the code for extracting conceptual components (CCs) and observed ontology design patterns (OODPs) from a corpus of ontology
- ``corpora``: two corpora that have been used for testing the extraction of CCs and ODPs pipeline (cultural heritage _CH_ and conference _Conf_ domain)
- ``results``: the results of the pipeline on the two corpora (CH and Conf), which are described in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12831, and the manual evaluation of the communities
